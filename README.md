Message Board Project:

This is a simple project that consists of a home page and a form page. The homepage renders a set of containers that displays a username, date of post, and message.
The form page allows new users to post to the page. Upon submission, the data.json file is overwritten to include the new post, and the webpage redirects to "home".

This project implements fundamental concepts for express, such as routing and error handling. It is also my first experience with writing JSON files and working with EJS.
Styling is intentionally spartan, as this is much closer to homework than portfolio work.

The try/catch used in controllers/prepData.js is only used for demo purposes. I acknowledge that isn't nearly robust enough for a real world application.
